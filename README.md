# Treehouse Techdegree Project 2
One of 12 **_Front End Web Development_** projects at [Treehouse Techdegree Courses](https://teamtreehouse.com/techdegree/front-end-web-development)

## Project Desription
In this project I build a responsive, mobile-first layout using HTML and CSS.

* I transferred a provided mockup, into HTML structure
* Then wrote CSS to style the page for a small mobile device first
* Then, using media queries, I added breakpoints to adjust the layout for wider tablet and desktop screens
